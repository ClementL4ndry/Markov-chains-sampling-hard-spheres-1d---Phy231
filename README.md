Graded homework for the class [Phys-231](https://isa.epfl.ch/imoniteur_ISAP/!itffichecours.htm?ww_i_matiere=3575330530&amp;amp;ww_x_anneeacad=2305107546&amp;amp;ww_i_section=945571&amp;amp;ww_i_niveau=6683117&amp;amp;ww_c_langue=fr) @EPFL

This homewrok was divided in two parts. 
In the first one we were asked to implement a Monte Carlo Markov chain simulation. For that we comuputed the stationary distribution using the transition matrix.
In the second part, we had to sample hard spheres from the uniform distribution. For that we tested different algorithm and compared them.

**Grade** : 5.65/6
**Errors** : Ex.1 : The coordinate system is mirrored along the Cartesian x axis-> The error propagates but easy to fix
